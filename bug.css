The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, sometimes unexpected results occur due to the order of operations or incorrect unit usage. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10px + 5%);` might produce unexpected results because the order is not explicitly specified. Also, mixing units inconsistently (e.g., `width: calc(100px + 5em)` can cause the browser to interpret the result inconsistently.)
