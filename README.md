# CSS calc() Issues
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS: unexpected results due to order of operations or inconsistent unit usage. 

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code. The `bugSolution.css` file demonstrates how to resolve the issue using parentheses to enforce the desired order of operations and using consistent units for calculations. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` (or create your own HTML file linking to `bug.css`) in a web browser.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior.
4. Open `bugSolution.html` (or create your own HTML file linking to `bugSolution.css`) to see how to correct this.
